# Marcel hub

State, app API, channel gateway and scheduler. Runs in Docker on the NUC. This page covers what
exists today: the app skeleton, the database, `GET /api/health`, and pairing a phone.

## Run

```bash
uv run marcel-hub
```

It listens on the `host` and `port` from the settings below. If the settings cannot be read, it
stops with `Marcel hub did not start.` and the reason.

On start the hub applies every pending database migration. If a migration fails, the hub does not
start and the error is printed in the log.

## Settings

Read from `/data/marcel.toml`, then from the environment (the environment wins). A missing file is
fine. A file that cannot be parsed, or an unknown key, stops the hub at start with a message that
names the file.

| Key | Environment | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `data_dir` | `MARCEL_DATA_DIR` | `/data` |
| `db_path` | `MARCEL_DB_PATH` | `<data_dir>/marcel.db` |
| `host` | `MARCEL_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` |
| `port` | `MARCEL_PORT` | `7420` |
| `owner_name` | `MARCEL_OWNER_NAME` | `Owner` (shown by `GET /api/me`) |

`MARCEL_CONFIG` moves the config file itself (tests use it).

## Database

SQLite through SQLModel; models are in `src/marcel_hub/models.py`, revisions in `migrations/`.
After changing a model, generate a revision and read it before committing:

```bash
uv run python -c "from alembic import command; from marcel_hub import db; \
e = db.make_engine('/tmp/new.db'); command.revision(db.alembic_config(e), message='what', autogenerate=True)"
```

A test fails if the models and the migrations disagree. Timestamps are timezone-aware UTC.

## GET /api/health

Needs no token. Returns `ok` (false when the database does not answer), `version`, and
`runner.reachable`. Until the runner client exists, `runner.reachable` is `false` with a reason.
The app shows that as "the NUC is not reachable", so it is expected for now.

## Pairing a phone

```bash
marcel-hub pair                                   # inside the hub container, or `uv run marcel-hub pair`
marcel-hub pair --hub http://127.0.0.1:7420/api   # a phone on the home network, no tunnel
```

It prints a QR code and an 8-letter code. The QR code holds
`marcel://pair?hub=<hub URL>&code=<code>` (`PairingCode` in the contract). The code works **once**,
for **10 minutes**. The app sends it to `POST /api/pair` and gets a device token back. A new
`marcel-hub pair` removes used and expired codes.

- A token is `mrc_` plus 32 random bytes in hex. The hub keeps only its sha256, so the token is
  shown once and cannot be read back from the database. Pairing codes are stored hashed too.
- Every route except `GET /api/health` and `POST /api/pair` needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
  Without it, or with a revoked token, the answer is 401. `/docs` and `/openapi.json` are off.
- `GET /api/devices` lists your devices; `DELETE /api/devices/{id}` revokes one, and its token
  stops working at once. `PUT /api/devices/{id}/push` stores an APNs token or ntfy topic.
- `GET /api/me` reports `push` as off for both backends until S-08.1 and S-08.2 add them, and every
  agent as `idle` until S-04.8.
- Every error has the contract's `Error` shape: a stable `code` and a `message` for people. A bad
  request body is a 400 with `code: bad_request`.

New routers protect themselves the same way, and read the caller with `current_device(request)`:

```python
router = APIRouter(prefix='/api', dependencies=[Depends(require_device)])
```

`tests/test_auth_routes.py` calls every route in the app without a token and fails on any that
answers something other than 401. A route type it cannot call (a WebSocket) fails it too, until the
test learns how.
