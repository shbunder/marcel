# Marcel hub

State, app API, channel gateway and scheduler. Runs in Docker on the NUC. This page covers what
exists today: the app skeleton, the database and `GET /api/health`.

## Run

```bash
uv run uvicorn --factory marcel_hub.app:create_app --port 7420
```

On start the hub applies every pending database migration. If a migration fails, the hub does not
start and the error is printed in the log.

## Settings

Read from `/data/marcel.toml`, then from the environment (the environment wins). A missing file is
fine. A file that cannot be parsed, or an unknown key, stops the hub at start with a message that
names the file.

| Key | Environment | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `data_dir` | `MARCEL_DATA_DIR` | `/data` |
| `db_path` | `MARCEL_DB_PATH` | `<data_dir>/marcel.db` |
| `host` | `MARCEL_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` |
| `port` | `MARCEL_PORT` | `7420` |

`MARCEL_CONFIG` moves the config file itself (tests use it).

## Database

SQLite through SQLModel; models are in `src/marcel_hub/models.py`, revisions in `migrations/`.
After changing a model, generate a revision and read it before committing:

```bash
uv run python -c "from alembic import command; from marcel_hub import db; \
e = db.make_engine('/tmp/new.db'); command.revision(db.alembic_config(e), message='what', autogenerate=True)"
```

A test fails if the models and the migrations disagree. Timestamps are timezone-aware UTC.

## GET /api/health

Needs no token. Returns `ok` (false when the database does not answer), `version`, and
`runner.reachable`. Until the runner client exists, `runner.reachable` is `false` with a reason.
The app shows that as "the NUC is not reachable", so it is expected for now.
